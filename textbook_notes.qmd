# Data Models

## General

- entities: features we care about (roads, mountains, accident locations)
- spatial object: entity-object correspondence
  - land cover: set of polygons
- characteristics of spatial detail subjectively chosen based on developer and needs
- spatial data model: objects in spatial database and their relationships
  - representing and manipulating spatially referenced information
- thematic layers are cartographic objects
- coordinate systems:
  - y-axis: "northing axis"; increases upward
  - x-axis: "easting axis"; increases to the right
- spherical coordinates (non-Cartesian)
  - larger area calculations on a 2-dimensional map can be distorted due to spherical nature of Earth
  - spherical coordinate calculations increase accuracy and precision
  - calculates via formulas using angles of rotation
  - meridians: lines of equal longitude (east-west); think vertical
  - parallels; lines of equal latitude; think horizontal
  - convergence at the poles causes distortion due to the degree of latitude spanning a greater distance near there
  - latitudes: usually preceded by N or S (based on equator)
  - longitudes: usually preceded by E or W (based on Prime Meridian / Greenwhich Meridian)
  - signed coordinates (instead of preceding cardinal direction)
    - northern latitudes are positive
    - southern latitudes are negative
    - eastern longitudes are positive
    - western longitudes are negative
  
## Common Spatial Data Models

- discrete objects defined via **vector data models**
  - uses discrete elements such as points, lines, and polygons to represent geometry of real-world entities
  - discrete vector object examples: fields, roads, wetlands, cities
  - points: small objects such as wells, buildings, ponds (again, what is subjectively chosen based on scale)
  - lines: network objects such as roads and rivers, or to enclose polygons for are entities
    - nodes: starting and ending points in a line
    - vertices: intermediate points in a line or polygon
- conceptualization via grid cells is a **raster data model**
  - splitting a map into rows and columns for "wall-to-wall" coverage
  - depending on resolution, decent for representing continuous changes across a region
- raster-vector is possible, but can come at the cost of computation or accuracy prices
- **Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)**: combination of point, line, and area features (less common than raster and vector data models)
- attribute data: non-spatial characteristics

### Vector Data Models (Discrete)

- uses groups of coordinates to represent entities
- lines can be a collection of smaller line segments or mathematical equations to represent geometric shape
- **multi-part-features**: a many-to-one relationship which is used to describe groupings (island, buildings, etc)
  - see Forms of Feature Generalization on [Generalization and the MAUP](generalization_maup.qmd)
- vector data has two common features:
  - polygon inclusion: 
    - areas within a polygon that are different but still considered part of it
    - imagine a polygon just representing a golf course, where the golf course also has fairways, roughs, ponds, pathways, etc.
    - those other features are "inclusions", but will often not be featured as their own polygon
    - this is due to some set lower limit, known as a **minimum mapping unit**
  - boundary generalization: incomplete representation of boundary locations
    - sampling of the true curve, typically contains some deviation from the "true" curved boundary
    
### Raster-Vector Model Conversion

#### Vector to Raster

- assign cell value for each position occupied by vector features
- points are usually assigned to the cell containing the point coordinate
- if cell size is too large, two or more points could fall in a single cell, leading to an ambiguous identification
  - typically, cell size is chosen such that diagonal cell dimension is smaller than the distance between the two closest point features
- can also be used for lines (versus coordinate points), where a cell-line intersection assigns the cell
  - can lead to wider approximation in adjacent cells taking on the same value
  
#### Raster to Vector

- identify set of continuous connected cells that form lines and apply smoothing algorithm

# Maps, Data Entry, Editiing, and Output

- graticular lines: lines representing constant latitude and longitude
  - lines may be curved depending on projection and scale
- accuracy vs. resolution (position accuracy vs. spatial resolution):
  - accuracy: how close a value is to the truth
  - resolution: smallest feature is individually resolved
  - many image data have average resolution smaller than their average accuracy
- scale: distance on a screen or map to the distance on Earth (reality)
  - can be unitless
  - large vs. small:
    - large scale maps: closer to reality (i.e. zoomed-in); more detailed; larger features; smaller area; trends towards less geometric error
    - small scale maps: further from reality (i.e. zoomed-out); less detailed; smaller features; larger area; trends towards more geometric error
