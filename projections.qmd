Projections are ways to visualization our three-dimensional Earth on a two-dimensional plane.

Key Concepts:

- Measuring the Earth:
  - Elipsoid
  - Geoid
  - Datums
- Displaying the Earth
  - General Coordinate Systems (i.e. Spherical and Cartesian)
  - Projections and Distortion Properties
  - Specific Coordinate Systems (i.e. UTM and State Plane)
  
# Measuring the Earth

## Definitions

- Geodesy: science of measuring the size and shape of the Earth
- Datum: a reference surface (i.e. set of known points) relative to an ellipsoid and a geoid
  - a site datum: a reference height against which elevations are measured
  - example: establish datum as a fixed elevation at the lowest point on the property, all heights are measured relative to the site (or local) datum

**The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but better defined by a geoid (hypothetical shape of the Earth). The Earth's shape can be properly defined by many ellipsoids, as it is flattened and roughly an ellipsoid in general.**

- A geoid is an object represented by many ellipsoids.
  - ellipsoids are mathematically defined
  - geoids are not mathematically defined, but is a measured surface
  - proper definition: **a geoid is the measured surface perpendicular to a plumb line determined by the pull of gravity.**

*Several experiments, particularly the Gochi Rocket, have shown that gravity does in fact change over different areas of the Earth.*

## Surfaces

When creating the geoid, there are three surfaces to keep track of:

- the ellipsoid
- the geoid
  - geoid undulation: height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference
- the physical surface

# Horitzontal Datum

Horizontal Datum: set of carefully surveyed reference points (surface) based on a given ellipsoid (approximating the geoid).

## Process

1. Define the shape of the Earth (ellipsoid)
2. Use triangulation surveys to dfine the location of a set of known control points - for which the position on the ellipsoid is precisely known (geodetic datum)
3. This is the reference surface and network agaisnt which all other points will be measured

## Ellipsoid and Datum Summary

- Ellipsoids: mathematically defined by 2 radii
  - Clarke 1866
  - World Geodetic System of 1972 (WGS72)
  - Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80)
  - World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84)
- Datum: reference points for establishing horizontal position
  - NAD27 (uses Clarke 1866)
  - NAD83 (uses GRS80)
  - Geodetic Datum of Australia (uses GRS80)
  - WGS84 “reference ellipsoid” (uses WGS84)
  
# General Coordinate Systemes

Spatial referencing system to locate points on the Earth's surface using pairs/triplets of numbers

- **Spherical Coordinates**: geographic / geodetic
  - Coordinates that describe locations on a sphere
  - Uses angles of rotation to define a directional vector
- **Planar**: cartesian
  - Coordinates that describe locations within a two-dimensional Cartesian space (mostly right angles)
  - rectangular grid with X and Y axes
    - X: easting axis
    - Y: northing axis
    - each point is defined by an X, Y coordinate

# Map Projection

A means of fitting features from the three-dimensional globe to a two-dimensional medium (i.e. map or computer screen), in reference to a datum.

- Necessary to display a spherical object on a flat surface
- Data from difference sources might fail to display if projections are not matching up
- Results in map distortions, which are projection errors
  - Distortion properties cannot simultaneously be preserved in two-dimensions
    - conformality (*a continuous sequence of deposits, typical in parallel strata*)
    - distance
    - direction
    - area
    
## Distortion Properties

- Expansion: projection from ellipsoid surface is closer to *light* source than map surface
- Compression: projection from map surface is closer to *light* source than map surface

![](images/distortion_1.png)

- conformality
  - **conformal** map projections preserve local shape (meridians and parallels intersect at right angles)
  - map scales the same everywhere and in any direction
- distance
  - distances are true only from the center of the projection to any other place (**equidistance**) but not between these places
- direction
  - great circle: shortest route between two points on a curved surface
  - along the spherical equivalent of a straight line on a flat surface
  - **true-direction** projections maintain these directions relative to center
- area
  - **equal area projections**: all mapped areas have the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they represent
  - shape, angle, and scale may be distorted
  
## Families of Map Projections

Most common projections are based on developable surfaces, which are geometric shapes onto which Earth locations are projected. Imaging a light source in the center of a globe, there are three main categories:

- planar (plane/azimuthal): projected onto a flat surface
- cylindrical: cylinder wrapped around the globe
- conic: cone wrapped around the globe

### Planar Projections

- Gnomonic: center
- Stereographic: antipode
- Orthographic: infinity

## Common Map Projections

### Lambert Conformal Conic

![](images/lambert_conformal_conic_1.png)

### Transverse Mercator

![](images/transverse_mercator_1.png)

### Global UTM System (Universal Transverse Mercator Coordinate System)

![](images/global_utm_1.png)

- Each zone is 6 degrees wide
- Zone location defined by a central meridian
- North Origin (at the equator $rightarrow$ **Northing=0**)
- South Origin (false northing of 10,000km)
- West (False Easting: 500,000km west of the zone's central Meridian)
- Coordinates are always positive
- Coorindates discontinuous across zone boundaries

**UTM Zones for US are 10-19 (West Coast to East Coast).**

### United States Plane Coordinate System (SPSC - State Plane Coordinate System)

- States Use Multiple Zones and Projections (some states use multiple within)
- Less distortion than UTM
  - high accuracy
  - projection distortions are roughly 4x better than UTM
- Issues: large metro areas can cover several counties and thus several state plane zones

#### Applying Projections to Zones

- Lambert Conformal Conic:
  - distortion increases with distance from central meridian
  - good for states with long North-South axis
- Mercator:
  - distortion increases with distance from parallels
  - good for states with long East-West axis
