Why do humans take the paths they do? Can these mobility patterns be quantified? What implications do paths and representations of real world entities have?\nTechnical definitions can change by industry or task. While representing real world entities and patterns, biases can be created both purposefully and accidentally. Across any science or field, implied causality can be dangerous. Understanding the tools and concepts is important for properly presenting information and not misusing the tools to imply incorrect phenomenon.\n\nDefining a GIS\n\nSpatial Thinking: a collection of cognitive skills\n\nconcepts of space\ntools of representation\nprocesses of reasoning\n\n\nSpatial Knowledge is important for orientation and navigation, map production, measuring the world, and understanding relationships between objects and the implication of such.\nA GIS is something that helps understand spatial knowledge by quantifying locations. They are computer-based information systems which aid in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, output, and distribution of spatial data. They require trained personnel, supporting institutions, have protocols for use, and can be web based.\nA simplified function-based definition:\n\ndata input\ndata management (storage/organization/retrieval)\ndata manipulation/analysis\ndata output\n\n\n\nComputational Tools for Spatial Knowledge\nSome examples of GIS, spatial analysis, and mapping tools:\n\nQGIS (open source)\nArcGIS (commercial)\nGeoDa (open, specialized)\nGoogle Maps (web)\nGoogle Earth (web)\nVGI (OSM)\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Components of a GIS\nThere are several components each GIS have:\n\ndatabase: registered map layers\nanalytic base:\n\nsoftware and algorithms\ncartometric analysis\nstatistical analysis\n\nmanagement base:\n\nmaintenance and update\naccess and data sharing\ndocumentation\n\n\n\nDatabases\n\nLinking Content:\n\nspatial registration (align all layers)\nGeoreferencing (at least one layer)\n\nEstablishing Geospatial Relations:\n\ndistance and direction\nproximity\nconnectivity\nassociation\ncontainment\n\nSupporting Geospatial Analysis\n\n\n\nAnalytical Base\n\nManipulating and Analyzing Data:\n\nexplore spatial relations\nelicit spatial patterns\nrun GIS analysis\n\nStatistical Elements:\n\n(spatial) statistics\nclassification\ndescriptive\n\nCartometric Elements\n\nspatial association\nspatial arrangement\nspatial patterns\n\nCartometric Elements and Geoprocessing: distance and direction measures (primitatives) ot build up higher order patterns\n\nspatial presence: location (x, y, z, t)\nspatial order: size and shape\nspatial arrangement:\n\ndensity\ndispersion\ndiffusion\nconnectivity\n\nspatial association (correspondence)\n\naddress matching\nbuffering\noverlay\nmodeling\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Base\n\nHandles data collection and storage\n\ndata maintenance and update\ndocumentation, tutorials, online help\n\nProvides access and security\n\nmultiple analysts working concurrently\nprotects against db corruption\nsecures proprietary information\n\nCreates and supports metadata\nMetadata:\n\ndata that describes geospatial data\n\nwho produced the data, when, and how\nwhat is the quality (truth in advertising)\nother measures and information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIS in an Instutional and Societal Context\n\nmanaging and assessing environmental problems, resource allocation, mapping, etc.\nlinking spatial information with attribute data to better understand lower and higher patterns of spatial distribution\nfrom an institutional perspective, trained analysts, decisions and protocols for collection and analylsis are incorporated"
