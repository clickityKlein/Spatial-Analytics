    "text": "How it Works\n\nRange by Speed of Light\n\nPosition is estimated based on range distances and travel time\n\ntravel time: difference between transmission time and reception time\nrange: speed of light * travel time (\\(range=c(t_1 - t_0)\\))\n\n\n\n\nTrilateration\n2-Dimensions\n\nGiven three pinged satellites, circles are drawn with center radii from the satellites\nThe intersection of the circles is the coordinate position\n\n3-Dimensions\n\nGiven four pinged satellites, spheres are drawn with center radii from hte satellites\nThe intersection of the spheres is the coordinate position\n\nNote that given three satellites in three-dimensions, there will be two points of intersection, which can be decent for stationary objects.\n\n\nRelativity\n\nSpecial Relativity: an observer on the ground sees satellites in motion relative to them, special relativity predicts we should see their clocks ticking more slowly (7 ms)\nGeneral Relativity: clocks closer to a massive object will seem to tick more slowly than those located further away, thus when viewed from the surface of the Earth, clocks on the satellites appear to be ticking faster (45 ms)\n\nClocks need to be adjusted by \\(45-7=38\\) ms per day. This is built into the satellites’ clocks.\n\n\nUncertainty\nErrors in range measurements and satellite location (ephermeris) introduces uncertainty, which can be a range for the GPS receiver position.\nMitigation using postion fixes for stationary receiver is possible, but does not work for moving receivers.\nSome Sources of Error:\n\nSatellite Clock Error\nSatellite Position Error - Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP)\nReceiver Error\nAtmospheric / Ionospheric Effects\nMultipath Error: additional potential error due to reflectance (i.e. obstructions)\n\nErrors are dependent on quality of equipment and environmental conditions.\n\nReflectance Error\n\n\n\nPDOP Uncertainty\nGeneral Idea of PDOP Range Uncertainty:\n\nPositional Dilution of Precision (high versus low PDOP depends on satellite spacing):\n\nLower PDOP results in a lower volume of a tetrahedron, thus lower uncertainty from PDOP.\n\n\n\nDifferential Correction\nBy using a base station, accuracy is increased by reducing range errors via estimating timing errors.\nGeneral Idea:\n\nRange Error versus Range Correction:\n\n\n\nTypes of Differential GPS\n\nPost Processed\n\nHigher accuracy\nHowever, done a posteriori\n\nReal-time\n\nLower accuracy\nBetter navigation\nrequires a transmitting base station\nrequires common link (FM radio or internet/cell phone)\n\n\n\n\nWide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)\nReal-time differential GPS developed for aircraft navigation. Based on a network of ground reference stations. Accuracy improves from ~13km to under 2m.\n\n\n\nOther Applications of GPS\n\nTracking\nNavigation\nField Digitizing\n\nGPS receiver\nrange pole\nlaser rangefinder\nelectronic compass\n\nHuman Mobility\nAutonomous Vehicles\nIndoor Mapping\n\nBluetooth\nRadio Frequency (RFID)\n\n\n\n\nOther Methods for Positioning\n\nSound Range\nCellular Positioning\nGPS Alternatives:\n\nGround Based GPS\nStarlink (prevents navigation jamming)"

    "text": "Key Notes:\nThe paper was written for a conference, the 4th International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling, which took place in 1990. There is some irony in reading this specific conference paper which is over three decades old, due to that fact that the author focuses on the longevity and survival of GIScience as an accepted institutional discipline. They touch on GIS being recongized more as a technology, and presses that GIS itself should be the science, only supported by technology applications rather than GIS as a supporting measure within the sciences. A few pathways Goodchild laid down to accomplish this is by “identifying key scientific questions” in GIScience and expanding on them intellectually. Essentially, they call for three communities specifically, “users, vendors, and researchers” to focus on the foundations of GIScience and then create the tools required to answer critical questions."
