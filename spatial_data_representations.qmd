Essential concepts for spatial data representations.

# Learning Objectives

- Spatial Data Representations
- Conceptualizations of Spatial Entities (Field and Object View)
- Types of Attribute Data
- Common Data Models

# Map Making

## Map Identities

- Title: a few words or a single sentence which informs the "where" and the "what" about the map
- Data Pane: map visual
- North Arrow: shows direction
- Neatline: inside media border, encapsulates datapane
- Media Border/Edge: very outside border
- Neatline and media border are not usually required, and are dependent on the publication
- Legend: provides information about what things like colors and boundaries
- Scale / Scale Bar: provides scale of map to reality

## Maps for Representation

- Feature Map:
  - cities
  - highways
- Choropleth Map:
  - shows density based on specific units
  - attribute is shown by a constant value
  - boundaries are artificial
  - assume the value is the same for an entire spatial boundary, which may not be true for the entire spatial boundary (*first glimpse at scale and MAUP*)
- Dot Density Map
  - maps individual points
  - more points equals higher density
- Contour Map (Isopleth Map)
  - line features to represent something (i.e. elevation)
  - limitations can be constant or minute changes, which may not be represented

# Real World Abstractions and Complexity

To represent information about this world in maps or digital systems, we need to simplify what we see. This requires **generalized, abstracted, and approximate** information about entities, their location and properties.

Why is this a requirement:

- Data may not be available
- May have too much data and need to choose the important aspects to simplify

## Mapping and Modeling Reality

- Entities: things in the real world which are represented by (cartographic) objects that contain essential characteristics
- *Can be biased by GIS data developer and purpose of map*
- Objects: abstract, imperfect representations of reality stored in a spatial database
- Biases can come from:
  - time constraints
  - design decisions
  
# Data Model

A consistent way of defining and representing objects in a databse, and of representing the relationships among the objects.

Spatial Data Models (usually two parts):

- coordinate data: pairs or triplets of numbers defining location
- attribute data: text, numbers, images, etc. (non-spatial data)

Spatial Data Models Construction:

- representation of objects in a spatial database and spatial relationships among them (topology)
- coordinate data: point of origin + spatial location + extent

## Spatial Object Types

Representation of entities graphically as spatial objects:

- points (0-Dimensional)
- lines (1-D)
- areas (2-D)
- surfaces (2.5-D)
- volumes (3-D)

These can be used concurrently to represent the same thing based on your objective.

## Attribute Data

- Non-spatial data for describing the characteristics of objects
- Nominal: descriptive (i.e. land use)
- Ordinal: ranked (city size - small, medium, large)
- Interval / Ratio: ranked and absolute difference
  - interval: meaningful differences between values (temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, pH)
  - ratio: contains a zero point (heat/weight, temperature in Kelvin)
  
## Thematic Layers

- separate layers for each view
- same spatial locations but represent different thematic entities
- combining information from different spatial datasets
- multiple objects from one entity (or several ones)

### Multiple Objects from a Single Entity

- Typically store different object types (even from the same entity) in different layers OR differentiated through attributes
- Lake Example:
  - municipal water source
  - recreation area
  - flood control sink
  - wildlife habitat

# Conceptualization of Spatial Phenomenon

- Object View: empty space contains **discrete objects** (lakes, land cover, etc.)
- Field View: phenomena varying over space **continuously** (elevation)

Ultimately, how do we define areas in an image:
  
- What is a forest?
- What is the map for? Or, who is it for?
- The natural instinct is to draw a line, but that can be difficult with things like gradual changes
- Or even classification challenges like a forest with a bush ground cover
