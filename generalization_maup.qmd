Essential concepts for generalization and the MAUP. This section builds from [Concepts of Scale and Resolution](concepts_scale_resolution.qmd).

# Learning Objectives

- Understand Generalization
- Understand MAUP
- Understand how these are unavoidable scenarios

# Generalization

**Map Generalization**:

- Unavoidable approximation of real entities represented on a map, which increases with smaller-scale maps.
- Geometric and attribute details needed has to be defined.
- Decisions, methods (and data) for collection and representation of shapes and locations define the limits of what can be seen on a map.

**Generalization** is a consequence of decreasing scale of a map ude to time, budget, and methods constraints.

**Aggregating / Disaggregating**:

- When zooming out, or decreasing resolution, aggregation occurs.
- When zooming in, or increasing resolution, disaggregation occurs.

## Scale and Map Generalization

There are different levels of feature generalization in maps of different scales. This introduces the idea of **geometry elimination** and **geometry smoothing** at changing scales. In both cases, we still want to preserve information. 

### Principals of Generalization

- Smaller Scales $\rightarrow$ More Generalized $\rightarrow$ Shorter Lines
- Machine learning can be used to preserve features during generalization
- Smaller Scales $\rightarrow$ More Generalized $\rightarrow$ Less Perimeter

### Forms of Feature Generalization

- Truth: entity in reality (example group of islands $\rightarrow$ multiple polygons with many vertices)
- Fused: multiple high resolution polygons into single polygon
- Simplified: multiple polygons with less vertices
- Displaced: features like roads or streams with a greater null buffer from group of polygons
- Omitted: smaller features (small islands) removed
- Exaggerated: features like roads or streams with a greater actual buffer from group of polygons
- Patches: essentially a fuse with the individual entities still present (group of islands called an archipelago while not mentioning the individual islands)

### Coastline Examples

The Florida coastline can be measured at different scales. The larger the scale, the longer the perimeter.

# The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)

The **MAUP** is a central problem in geographical data that needs to be understood.

The problem can be summarized by two effects:

- size effect
- zoning effect

Aggregate values from groups of polygons depend on size (*size effect*) and shape (*zoning effect*) of the aggregated polygons and can suffer from **statistical bias**.

- Aggregation changes statistical characteristics
- Study by Openshaw and Taylor (1979) found the percentage of elderly voters and the number of Republican voters in counties of Iowa correlations between 0.98 and -0.81 with varying aggregation levels of counties. 

## Analytical Scale

**What is the correct size of analytical scale?**

![](images/analytical_scale_1.png)

There are multiple proposed solutions to finding this solution, including *sensitivity testing*, which checks for robustness or variation at different scales. Spatial auto-correlation is ant

## Scale Effect

- Different analytical results at levels of aggregation: as we increase or decrease resolution, the statistical characteristics change.

## Zoning Effect

- Different groupings by various artificial boundaries, each boundary variation yields major analytical differences
- Examples:
  - health spatial statistics to determine spatial factors realted to given disease
  - demography
  - landscape ecology
  - gerrymandering

## Solutions

Essentially, a population suffers from MAUP due to the population not being uniformly distributed by density over locations.

- spatial autocorrelation (no random distribution)
- across different scales: check for robustness or variation
- if results are significantly different, reevaluate to find more consistent results
  - across-scale relationship evaluation between variables; simulations and spatial models
  - avoid erroneous conclusions
  - provide guidance to select appropriate aggregation scales
