Essential concepts for scale and resolution.

# Learning Objectives

To define **scale** and **resolution**, understand the importance in their difference, and the impact of scale and resolution on measurements and analysis in a GIS.

# Map Scale

Definitions:

- amount of reduction in the representation of a real world phenomenon on a map
- ratio between map distance and real world distance
  - unitliess ratio: 1/100,000 or 1:100,000
  - unti ratio: 2 inches to 10 miles
  
## Scale Sizes (Large vs. Small)

**Large Scale vs. Small Scale**

- Large Scale Maps
  - larger features
  - more detail
  - less area
  - tending towards less geometric error
- Small Scale Maps
  - smaller features
  - less detail
  - more area
  - tending towards more geometric error
  
  **Explanation**

- Comparing Scales:
 - Map A Scale: $1/a$
 - Map B Scale: $1/b$
 - Larger the Denominator $\rightarrow$ Smaller the Scale
 - Smaller the Denominator $\rightarrow$ Larger the Scale
 - So, provided $a > b \rightarrow 1/a < 1/b$, thus
  - Map A has a smaller scale than Map B
  - Map B has a larger scale than Map A
  - Example: Map A could cover Washington state whereas Map B could cover a city in Washington state
  - Further Explanation: The smaller the relative scale, the closer the map to reality
  
# Map Resolution

There are two main components with resolution:

- resolution: smallest spatial addressable unit
  - raster data: cell size
  - vector data: line segment
- detection: smallest detectable feature

## Raster - The Mixed Pixel Problem / Effect

How do we define/classify a cell (i.e. land vs. water)?

Rule of Thumb: **the smallest detectable feature is about twice as large as the resolution**, or stated in another manner, **detection requires resolution at least twice as fine as detectable features.**

So if we were going to **detect** a defined bodies of water, the bodies of water we wish to detect were around size $x$, the **resolution** must be at most $x/2$. This ensures that the features of interest are adequately captured and distinguished from surrounding features.

## Tradeoff Between Storage and Resolution

As the saying goes, easier said than done. Images with finer resolution require more storage and are usually more expensive (technology / equipment).

In fact, **decreasing the cell size by one half quadruples the resolution, thus storage space is quadrupled.**

**Note that in the case of vector data, finer resolution vector data has more points and points closer together. In other words, more vertices!**

# Scale vs. Resolution

- In (paper) maps, data resolution is tied to scale
- An example is road networks in paper maps. Given a large scale paper map, what is the smallest addressable unit of a linear object that should be shown?

## Digital Data and Scale

**DIGITAL DATA HAS A SCALE! HOWEVER, CAUTION IS REQUIRED.**

The input map / data layer had a scale (*source scale*), but many data today does not come from maps. This allows us to slide through a range of scales on the screen. *Think about the increasing detail level while zooming in on Google Maps*.

This gives us the **Display Scale**, the ratio between ground and on-screen scale.
