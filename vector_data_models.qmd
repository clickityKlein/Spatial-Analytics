Specifically, this section will cover vector models and their relation to topology.

Recall a vector model is a model made with points, lines, and polygons, representing entities and features. There can also be associated attributes, which are the non-spatial components of a model.

Vector models can commonly be represented as:

- non-topological vector models
- topological vector models

# Non-Topological Vector Data Model

- Advantages
  - simple (often *open* file standards)
  - efficient for display and plotting
- Disadvantages
  - can contain duplicate common boundaries (increases costs due storage and analysis)
  - can be inefficient for spatial analysis
  - editing and querying can be difficult
  
*Can be referred to as spaghetti models.*
  
# Topological Vector Data Model

**Topology**: geometric properties that do not chance with changes shapes, specifically the following properties:

- adjacency
- connectivity
- containment

A topologically defined model can have its shape changed (or **warped**) and still retain its properties.

- Advantages
  - data storage reduced (boundary arcs stored once)
  - explicit neighbor relations maintained
    - useful for cleaning, digitizing, analysis, and queries
- Disadvantages
  - computational overhead
  - draws slower

## Snapping

Given a snap tolerance, points and lines can be combined into shared boundaries. Essentially, points are automatically set to have the same coordinates. *They become magnetic*. Position errors can stem during build processes, especially when digitizing.

Snap tolerance must be chosen carefully:

- undershooting: node does not quite reach other node or line
- overshooting: lines cross over existing nodes or lines
- rule of thumb: should be smaller than the desired positional accuracy

# Advanced Data Model with Applied Topology

- Network Models
  - routes
  - hydrology (i.e. river networks with help in flooding scenarios)
  - other models with attributes that can affect a **cost**
  - can get very complex
  - given a topologically regulated network, can change shape without changing properties, must follow:
    - adjacency
    - connectivity
    - containment
- Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs)
  - create a network over a landscape with triangles to represent terrain elevation via a topological network
  - points (nodes) can be actual measured references
  - edges are formed between the nodes
  - the triangular faces are known as facets
  - adhere to the topological properties:
    - adjacency
    - connectivity
    - containment
